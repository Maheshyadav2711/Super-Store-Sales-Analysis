# Key Insights from the Superstore Sales Dashboard

Sales vs Profit: While overall sales are growing steadily, profit margins are inconsistent across categories. Some categories show high sales but low or negative profit.

Category Performance: Technology and Office Supplies generate the highest revenue, while Furniture shows lower profit margins despite good sales volume.

Regional Analysis: The West and East regions perform strongly in terms of revenue, while the South region contributes the least to total sales.

Segment Trends: Consumer segment drives the majority of sales, followed by Corporate. The Home Office segment lags behind both in sales and profit.

Sub-Category Insights: Products like Phones and Copiers are highly profitable, while Tables and Bookcases often lead to losses.

Time-Based Trends: Sales show seasonality, with noticeable spikes in the last quarter of the year, indicating strong holiday season performance.

Shipping Impact: Standard Class shipping is used most frequently, but Same Day shipping contributes less to sales and higher costs, impacting profit margins.

## Tools Used
